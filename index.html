			<h2>Permutations of a Standard Card Deck</h2>
	<p>It is theorized that each time a deck of cards is shuffled, the resulting combination of cards is unique in the history of the world,
		and that each time a deck is shuffled, that order has never occurred before. In a deck of 54 cards (one that includes two Jokers), each combination is one out of 230,843,697,339,241,380,472,092,742,683,027,581,083,278,564,571,807,941,132,288,000,000,000,000 possible combinations!</p>
